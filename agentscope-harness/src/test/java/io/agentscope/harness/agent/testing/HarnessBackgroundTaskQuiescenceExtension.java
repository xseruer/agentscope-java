/**
 * Auto-registered JUnit Jupiter extension that drains fire-and-forget harness background
 * tasks (memory flush/maintenance) after every test method.
 *
 * <p>{@link io.agentscope.harness.agent.HarnessAgent#close()} drains the same trackers, but
 * many harness tests build a transient {@code HarnessAgent}, call {@code .block()}, and let it
 * be garbage-collected without closing it. The fire-and-forget memory flush dispatched in
 * {@code MemoryFlushMiddleware#onAgent}'s {@code doOnComplete} then races with JUnit's
 * {@code @TempDir} teardown: the async write still holds file handles (or creates files after
 * the walk) when the temp directory is deleted, producing the flaky
 * {@code "Failed to delete temp directory"} / {@code "Failed to close extension context"}
 * errors seen across harness integration tests on both Linux and Windows runners.
 *
 * <p>This callback runs after the test method and after {@code @AfterEach} methods, but
 * <em>before</em> the JUnit {@code TempDir} extension closes the extension context and deletes
 * the temp directory, so the background writes have quiesced first. When nothing is in flight
 * the await call returns immediately, making this a no-op for tests that never
 * trigger a flush. If the trackers fail to quiesce within the timeout (or the thread is
 * interrupted), the callback throws {@link AssertionError} so the failure is deterministic and
 * points at the root cause rather than surfacing later as an opaque
 * {@code "Failed to delete temp directory"}.
