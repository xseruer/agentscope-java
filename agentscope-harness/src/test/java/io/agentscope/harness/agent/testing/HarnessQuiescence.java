/**
 * Composed annotation that registers {@link HarnessBackgroundTaskQuiescenceExtension} so
 * fire-and-forget harness background tasks (memory flush/maintenance) are drained after each test, before JUnit deletes its {@code @TempDir}.
 *
 * <p>Apply to any test that builds a {@code HarnessAgent}, drives it to completion
 * ({@code .block()} / {@code .stream()...block()}), and uses {@code @TempDir} for the
 * workspace or state home. Without this, the async memory flush dispatched in
 * {@code MemoryFlushMiddleware#onAgent}'s {@code doOnComplete} races with
 * {@code @TempDir} teardown and surfaces as the flaky
 * {@code "Failed to delete temp directory"} / {@code "Failed to close extension context"}
 * error. Calling {@code HarnessAgent.close()} has the same effect; this annotation covers
 * tests that build a transient agent and never close it.
